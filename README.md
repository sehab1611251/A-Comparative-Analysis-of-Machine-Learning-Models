This project aims to predict national happiness levels using five distinct machine learning models: Multiple Linear Regression, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Naive Bayes. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of these models in forecasting the Life Ladder score, a self-reported measure of life satisfaction that serves as the national happiness in this context. The project further extends its predictive capabilities by classifying countries into various happiness levels, ranging from “very unhappy” to “very happy,” based on socioeconomic and well-being indicators.
